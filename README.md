# mass_spring_damper_system

This project aims to simulate a mass spring system with dampening and under action of some external force.

The external force is considered constant.

The equation of motion of system second order ode.

Range-Kutta RK4 is used for solving second order ode.

To get output :
	make
Th clean the output :
	make clean
